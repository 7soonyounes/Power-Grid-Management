# Power-Grid-Management
Build a microgrid architecture to make a scholar institution energetically smart and self-independent using Reinforcement Learning, we create two agents a smart-grid agent following the Q-learning algorithm and a baseline agent that can be used as a benchmark to compare the performance of other agents that use learning algorithms.
